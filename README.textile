This package makes certain ZCS core libraries (from mailboxd/lib/jars/)
available in the individual servlet containers, by setting symlinks.

Most other zimlet or extension packages will rely on that.

*Note*: this package is heavily tied to the ZCS base version.
Therefore the first three digits of the package version are aligned to the appropriate ZCS base version.
