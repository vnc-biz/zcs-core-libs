This package is highly dependent on the ZCS base version.

You *must not* mix them up, otherwise the ZCS installation will
be deeply damaged.

Therefore we have separate branches for each ZCS base version:

    master-7.2		baseline for ZCS 7.2.0 based versions
    7_1_old		old 7.1.x based, untested and likely obsolete
